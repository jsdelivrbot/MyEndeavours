These XML reference files continue to evolve.  Please feel
free to use them, but check www.openapplications.org for the most 
recent updates.

OAGIS 9.2 contains XML Schema, HTML documenation, pdfs of the UML Class 
diagrams for each Noun, example XML documents and example WSDLs. To view 
XML Schema it is recommended that you use an XML IDE, as the complete 
structure of the Business Object Documents are not viewable from a single file.

Note that the sample files were used to verify the XMLSchema 
development, and do not necessarily reflect actual business 
transactions.  In many cases,the data entered in the XML files are just 
placeholder text.  Real-world examples for each transaction will be 
provided as they become available. If you are interested in providing 
real-world examples please contact oagis@openapplications.org


Please send suggestions or bug reports to oagis@openapplications.org

Thank you for your interest and support.

Best Regards,
The Open Applications Group XML Project Team
